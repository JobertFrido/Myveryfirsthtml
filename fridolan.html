<p> Hello! Guys welcome to my new html webpage on Offroading<br> Now lets talk about "What is offroading?"</p>

<h2 align="left"> What is Offroading? </h2>
<p> Off-roading is the activity of driving or riding a vehicle on unsurfaced roads or tracks, made of materials such as sand, gravel, riverbeds, mud, snow, rocks, and other natural terrain. Types of off-roading range in intensity, from leisure drives with unmodified vehicles to competitions with customized vehicles and professional drivers. Off-roaders have been met with criticism for the environmental damage caused by their vehicles. There have also been extensive debates over the role of government in regulating the sport, including a Supreme Court case brought against the Bureau of Land Management.
</p>
<p> One of the most famous form of offroading is the rockcrawling. Rock Crawling is actually fun while watching but it is hard as hell for the driver. Yeah he needs to crawl very carefully or else he might end up in sliding or rolling of the vehicle. here are some pictures to demostrate what rockcrawling actually looks like </p>

<h2 align="left"> Offroading Events </h2>
<p>In some countries off-road activities are strictly regulated, while others promote cross country off-road endurance events like the Dakar Rally, Spanish Baja, Africa Eco Race, Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge, Russian Baja Northern Forest, San Felipe 250 and Baja 500 & 1000, and the which are a test of navigation skills and machine durability.[citation needed] off road parks and motocross tracks also host a number of events and may be the only legal place to off-road in the area. Events include jamborees, rock crawling competitions, Mud Bog races, Top Truck Challenges and sand racing as well as many other events, such as the Tank Trap.</p>

<h3>Now lets see the dangers of this popular offroading.If it has fun then it should have its own dangers right? if it has a pro there should be a con. likewise offroading has its own dangers. Now, lets see about it.

<h2 align="left">  Dangers of Vehicle Lifting: <h2>
</div>
<p>While lifting a vehicle to gain ground clearance is helpful to off-roaders, it can also make a vehicle dangerous as, when a vehicle has been lifted, its center of gravity rises, which causes the vehicle to be more likely to tumble in certain situations. Other dangers include loss of visibility of smaller objects and bumper height as compared to other vehicles on the road. In the United States, bumper and frame height laws are effective in most states to ensure that the vehicles on the road are not too much higher than their average car counterparts. Lifting vehicles improperly without taking driveline angles into consideration will wear out suspension components faster and make them more prone to failure</p>
